#ff.get_random_macrostates_for_datasets(datasets)
""" Find random macrostates for combinations of N and S found in datasets. 
    The user should check the 'get_random_macrostates_for_datasets' function in the module
    'feasible_functions' to ensure that the desired number of random macrostates, along
    with other options are chosen. Alternatively, the user can email Ken Locey
    ken@weecology.org to request a copy of the macrostates we generated; it will be sent ASAP. """

""" This function is not necessary to reproduce results from Locey and White (2013), as the list
    of N-S combinations used in that paper are provided below. However, if the user wishes to generate figure 5
    for a different set of N-S combos, they should run the above function to find which combos meet the criteria.
    
    Arguments for the above function:
    1. Name of dataset. This corresponds to a file ending in '_data.txt', e.g. 'FIA' matches FIA_data.txt
    2. Minimum N. This is the smallest value of N to be considered.
    3. Largest difference between values of N; allows for similar but not identical values of N. When set at
       zero, all values of N must be identical
    4. Largest difference between values of S; allows for similar but not identical values of S. When set at 
       zero, all values of S must be identical
    5. Minimum sample size. N-S combos with less than this number of replicates are ignored,
       with or without a tolerance for varying N and S.
